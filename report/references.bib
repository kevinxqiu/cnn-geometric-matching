	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

	abstract = {The problem of arbitrary object tracking has traditionally been tackled by learning a model of the object's appearance exclusively online, using as sole training data the video itself. Despite the success of these methods, their online-only approach inherently limits the richness of the model they can learn. Recently, several attempts have been made to exploit the expressive power of deep convolutional networks. However, when the object to track is not known beforehand, it is necessary to perform Stochastic Gradient Descent online to adapt the weights of the network, severely compromising the speed of the system. In this paper we equip a basic tracking algorithm with a novel fully-convolutional Siamese network trained end-to-end on the ILSVRC15 dataset for object detection in video. Our tracker operates at frame-rates beyond real-time and, despite its extreme simplicity, achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple benchmarks.},

            The processing of microscopy images constitutes a bottleneck for large-scale experiments. A critical step is the establishment of cell borders (‘segmentation’), which is required for a range of applications such as growth or fluorescent reporter measurements. For the model organism budding yeast (
            Saccharomyces cerevisiae
            ), a number of methods for segmentation exist. However, in experiments involving multiple cell cycles, stress, or various mutants, cells crowd or exhibit irregular visible features, which necessitate frequent manual corrections. Furthermore, budding events are visually subtle but important to detect. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully employed for a range of image processing applications. They require large, diverse training sets. Here, we present i) the first set of publicly available, high-quality segmented yeast images ({\textgreater}10’000 cells) including mutants, stressed cells, and time courses, ii) a corresponding U-Net-based CNN, iii) a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) to efficiently use the system, and iv) a web application to test it (
            www.quantsysbio.com
            ). A key feature is a cell-cell boundary test which avoids the need for additional input from fluorescent channels. A bipartite graph matching algorithm tracks cells in time with high reliability. Our network is highly accurate and outperforms existing methods on benchmark images recorded by others, suggesting it transfers well to other conditions. Furthermore, new buds are detected early with high reliability. We apply the system to detect differences in geometry between wild-type and cyclin mutant cells. Our results indicate that morphogenesis control occurs unexpectedly early in the cell cycle and is gradual, demonstrating how the efficient processing of large numbers of cells uncovers new biology. Our system can serve as a resource to the community, expanded continuously with new images. Furthermore, the techniques we develop here are likely to be useful for other organisms as well.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            Analyzing cells and tissues under a microscope is a cornerstone of biological research and clinical practice. However, the challenge faced by conventional microscopy image analysis is the fact that cell recognition through a microscope is still time-consuming and lacks both accuracy and consistency. Despite enormous progress in computer-aided microscopy cell detection, especially with recent deep-learning-based techniques, it is still difficult to translate an established method directly to a new cell target without extensive modification. The morphology of a cell is complex and highly varied, but it has long been known that cells show a nonrandom geometrical order in which a distinct and defined shape can be formed in a given type of cell. Thus, we have proposed a geometry-aware deep-learning method, geometric-feature spectrum ExtremeNet (GFS-ExtremeNet), for cell detection. GFS-ExtremeNet is built on the framework of ExtremeNet with a collection of geometric features, resulting in the accurate detection of any given cell target. We obtained promising detection results with microscopic images of publicly available mammalian cell nuclei and newly collected protozoa, whose cell shapes and sizes varied. Even more striking, our method was able to detect unicellular parasites within red blood cells without misdiagnosis of each other.
            
              IMPORTANCE
              Automated diagnostic microscopy powered by deep learning is useful, particularly in rural areas. However, there is no general method for object detection of different cells. In this study, we developed GFS-ExtremeNet, a geometry-aware deep-learning method which is based on the detection of four extreme key points for each object (topmost, bottommost, rightmost, and leftmost) and its center point. A postprocessing step, namely, adjacency spectrum, was employed to measure whether the distances between the key points were below a certain threshold for a particular cell candidate. Our newly proposed geometry-aware deep-learning method outperformed other conventional object detection methods and could be applied to any type of cell with a certain geometrical order. Our GFS-ExtremeNet approach opens a new window for the development of an automated cell detection system.},

However, accurate, automated, and easy-to-use cell segmentation remains a challenge, especially in cases of high cell densities, where discrete boundaries are not easily discernable. Here, we present a fully automated segmentation algorithm that iteratively segments cells based on the observed distribution of optical cell volumes measured by quantitative phase microscopy. By fitting these distributions to known probability density functions, we are able to converge on volumetric thresholds that enable valid segmentation cuts. Since each threshold is determined from the observed data itself, virtually no input is needed from the user. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach over time using six cell types that display a range of morphologies, and evaluate these cultures over a range of confluencies. Facile dynamic measures of cell mobility and function revealed unique cellular behaviors that relate to tissue origins, state of differentiation, and real-time signaling. These will improve our understanding of multicellular communication and organization.},

	abstract = {Specific cell surface labeling is essential for visualizing the internalization processes of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and for gaining mechanistic insight of GPCR functions. Here we present a rapid, specific, and versatile labeling scheme for GPCRs at living-cell membrane with the use of a split green fluorescent protein (GFP). Demonstrated with two GPCRs, GPR17 and CysLT2R, we show that two β-stands (β-stands 10 and 11) derived from a superfolder GFP (sfGFP) can be engineered to one of the three extracellular loop of a GPCR. The complementary fragment of sfGFP has nine β-strands (β-stands 1-9) that carries the mature fluorophore, and can be proteolytically derived from the full-length sfGFP. Separately the GFP fragments are non-fluorescent, but become fluorescent upon assembly, thus allowing specific labeling of the target proteins. The two GFP fragments rapidly assemble and the resulting complex is extremely tight under non-denaturing conditions, which allows real-time and quantitative assessment of the internalized GPCRs. We envision that this labeling scheme will be of great use for labeling other membrane proteins in various biological and pharmacological applications.},

In contrast to the bulk of research on social networks that has focused almost exclusively on positive interpretations of links between people, we study how the interplay between positive and negative relationships affects the structure of on-line social networks. We connect our analyses to theories of signed networks from social psychology. We ﬁnd that the classical theory of structural balance tends to capture certain common patterns of interaction, but that it is also at odds with some of the fundamental phenomena we observe — particularly related to the evolving, directed nature of these on-line networks. We then develop an alternate theory of status that better explains the observed edge signs and provides insights into the underlying social mechanisms. Our work provides one of the ﬁrst large-scale evaluations of theories of signed networks using on-line datasets, as well as providing a perspective for reasoning about social media sites.},

            This study reports on a microfluidic platform on which single multicellular spheroids from malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), an aggressive tumor with poor prognosis, can be loaded, trapped and tested for chemotherapeutic drug response. A new method to detect the spheroid viability cultured on the microfluidic chip as a function of the drug concentration is presented. This approach is based on the evaluation of the caspase activity in the supernatant sampled from the chip and tested using a microplate reader. This simple and time-saving method does only require a minimum amount of manipulations and was established for very low numbers of cells. This feature is particularly important in view of personalised medicine applications for which the number of cells obtained from the patients is low. MPM spheroids were continuously perfused for 48 hours with cisplatin, one of the standard chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat MPM. The 50\% growth inhibitory concentration of cisplatin in perfused MPM spheroids was found to be twice as high as in spheroids cultured under static conditions. This chemoresistance increase might be due to the continuous support of nutrients and oxygen to the perfused spheroids.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture is considered more clinically relevant in mimicking the structural and physiological conditions of tumors in vivo compared to two-dimensional cell cultures. In recent years, high-throughput screening (HTS) in 3D cell arrays has been extensively used for drug discovery because of its usability and applicability. Herein, we developed a microfluidic spheroid culture device (μFSCD) with a concentration gradient generator (CGG) that enabled cells to form spheroids and grow in the presence of cancer drug gradients. The device is composed of concave microwells with several serpentine micro-channels which generate a concentration gradient. Once the colon cancer cells (HCT116) formed a single spheroid (approximately 120 μm in diameter) in each microwell, spheroids were perfused in the presence of the cancer drug gradient irinotecan for three days. The number of spheroids, roundness, and cell viability, were inversely proportional to the drug concentration. These results suggest that the μFSCD with a CGG has the potential to become an HTS platform for screening the efficacy of cancer drugs.},

          , 
            
              A mounting body of evidence in cancer research suggests that the local microenvironment of tumor cells has a profound influence on cancer progression and metastasis.
              In vitro
              studies on the tumor microenvironment and its pharmacological modulation, however, are often hampered by the technical challenges associated with creating physiological cell culture environments that integrate cancer cells with the key components of their native niche such as neighboring cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) to mimic complex microarchitecture of cancerous tissue. Using early-stage breast cancer as a model disease, here we describe a biomimetic microengineering strategy to reconstitute three-dimensional (3D) structural organization and microenvironment of breast tumors in human cell-based
              in vitro
              models. Specifically, we developed a microsystem that enabled co-culture of breast tumor spheroids with human mammary ductal epithelial cells and mammary fibroblasts in a compartmentalized 3D microfluidic device to replicate microarchitecture of breast ductal carcinoma
              in situ
              (DCIS). We also explored the potential of this breast cancer-on-a-chip system as a drug screening platform by evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of an anticancer drug (paclitaxel). Our microengineered disease model represents the first critical step towards recapitulating pathophysiological complexity of breast cancer, and may serve as an enabling tool to systematically examine the contribution of the breast cancer microenvironment to the progression of DCIS to an invasive form of the disease.},

	abstract = {The ideal in vitro recreation of the micro-tumor niche—although much needed for a better understanding of cancer etiology and development of better anticancer therapies—is highly challenging. Tumors are complex three-dimensional (3D) tissues that establish a dynamic cross-talk with the surrounding tissues through complex chemical signaling. An extensive body of experimental evidence has established that 3D culture systems more closely recapitulate the architecture and the physiology of human solid tumors when compared with traditional 2D systems. Moreover, conventional 3D culture systems fail to recreate the dynamics of the tumor niche. Tumor-on-chip systems, which are microﬂuidic devices that aim to recreate relevant features of the tumor physiology, have recently emerged as powerful tools in cancer research. In tumor-on-chip systems, the use of microﬂuidics adds another dimension of physiological mimicry by allowing a continuous feed of nutrients (and pharmaceutical compounds). Here, we discuss recently published literature related to the culture of solid tumor-like tissues in microﬂuidic systems (tumor-on-chip devices). Our aim is to provide the readers with an overview of the state of the art on this particular theme and to illustrate the toolbox available today for engineering tumor-like structures (and their environments) in microﬂuidic devices. The suitability of tumor-on-chip devices is increasing in many areas of cancer research, including the study of the physiology of solid tumors, the screening of novel anticancer pharmaceutical compounds before resourcing to animal models, and the development of personalized treatments. In the years to come, additive manufacturing (3D bioprinting and 3D printing), computational ﬂuid dynamics, and medium- to high-throughput omics will become powerful enablers of a new wave of more sophisticated and eﬀective tumor-on-chip devices.},

Perfused capillary network can be a solution for this issue; however, construction of a complete capillary network at single cell level using the existing technology is nearly impossible due to limitations in time and spatial resolution of the dispensing technology. To address the vascularization issue, we developed a 3D printing method to construct larger (lumen size of {\textasciitilde}1 mm) ﬂuidic vascular channels and to create adjacent capillary network through a natural maturation process, thus providing a feasible solution to connect the capillary network to the large perfused vascular channels. In our model, microvascular bed was formed in between two large ﬂuidic vessels, and then connected to the vessels by angiogenic sprouting from the large channel edge. Our bio-printing technology has a great potential in engineering vascularized thick tissues and vascular niches, as the vascular channels are simultaneously created while cells and matrices are printed around the channels in desired 3D patterns.},

	abstract = {Engineering vascularized tissue constructs and organoids has been historically challenging. Here we describe a novel method based on microfluidic bioprinting to generate a scaffold with multilayer interlacing hydrogel microfibers. To achieve smooth bioprinting, a core-sheath microfluidic printhead containing a composite bioink formulation extruded from the core flow and the crosslinking solution carried by the sheath flow, was designed and fitted onto the bioprinter. By blending gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) with alginate, a polysaccharide that undergoes instantaneous ionic crosslinking in the presence of select divalent ions, followed by a secondary photocrosslinking of the GelMA component to achieve permanent stabilization, a microfibrous scaffold could be obtained using this bioprinting strategy. Importantly, the endothelial cells encapsulated inside the bioprinted microfibers can form the lumen-like structures resembling the vasculature over the course of culture for 16 days. The endothelialized microfibrous scaffold may be further used as a vascular bed to construct a vascularized tissue through subsequent seeding of the secondary cell type into the interstitial space of the microfibers. Microfluidic bioprinting provides a generalized strategy in convenient engineering of vascularized tissues at high fidelity.},

Here we report a method to engineer the 3D microenvironment of human tumors, by encapsulating cancer cells in the core of microcapsules with a hydrogel shell for miniaturized 3D culture to obtain avascular microtumors ﬁrst. The microtumors are then used as the building blocks for assembling with endothelial cells and other stromal cells to create macroscale 3D vascularized tumor. Cells in the engineered 3D microenvironment can yield signiﬁcantly larger tumors in vivo than 2D-cultured cancer cells. Furthermore, the 3D vascularized tumors are 4.7 and 139.5 times more resistant to doxorubicin hydrochloride (a commonly used chemotherapy drug) than avascular microtumors and 2D-cultured cancer cells, respectively. Moreover, this high drug resistance of the 3D vascularized tumors can be overcome by using nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery. The high-ﬁdelity 3D tumor model may be valuable for studying the eﬀect of microenvironment on tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis and for developing eﬀective therapeutic strategy to ﬁght against cancer.},

	abstract = {Gradients of diffusive molecules within 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) are essential in guiding many processes such as development, angiogenesis, and cancer. The spatial distribution of factors that guide these processes is complex, dictated by the distribution and architecture of vasculature and presence of surrounding cells, which can serve as sources or sinks of factors. To generate temporally and spatially defined soluble gradients within a 3D cell culture environment, we developed an approach to patterning microfluidically ported microchannels that pass through a 3D ECM. Micromolded networks of sacrificial conduits ensconced within an ECM gel precursor solution are dissolved following ECM gelation to yield functional microfluidic channels. The dimensions and spatial layout of channels are readily dictated using photolithographic methods, and channels are connected to external flow via a gasket that also serves to house the 3D ECM. We demonstrated sustained spatial patterning of diffusive gradients dependent on the architecture of the microfluidic network, as well as the ability to independently populate cells in either the channels or surrounding ECM, enabling the study of 3D morphogenetic processes. To highlight the utility of this approach, we generated model vascular networks by lining the channels with endothelial cells and examined how channel architecture, through its effects on diffusion patterns, can guide the location and morphology of endothelial sprouting from the channels. We show that locations of strongest gradients define positions of angiogenic sprouting, suggesting a mechanism by which angiogenesis is regulated in vivo and a potential means to spatially defining vasculature in tissue engineering applications. This flexible 3D microfluidic approach should have utility in modeling simple tissues and will aid in the screening and identification of soluble factor conditions that drive morphogenetic events such as angiogenesis. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

We found that vascularized kidney organoids cultured under flow had more mature podocyte and tubular compartments with enhanced cellular polarity and adult gene expression compared with that in static controls. Glomerular vascular development progressed through intermediate stages akin to those involved in the embryonic mammalian kidney's formation of capillary loops abutting foot processes. The association of vessels with these compartments was reduced after disruption of the endogenous VEGF gradient.

	abstract = {Breast carcinomas can be stratified into different entities based on clinical behavior, histologic features, and/or by biological properties. A classification of breast cancer should be based on underlying biology, which we know must be determined by the somatic genomic landscape of mutations. Moreover, because the latest generations of anticancer agents are founded on biological mechanisms, a detailed molecular stratification is a requirement for appropriate clinical management. Such stratification, based on genomic drivers, will be important for selecting patients for clinical trials. It will also facilitate the discovery of novel drivers, the study of tumor evolution, and the identification of mechanisms of treatment resistance. Assays for risk stratification have focused mainly on response prediction to existing treatment regimens. Molecular stratification based on gene expression profiling revealed that breast cancers could be classified in so-called intrinsic subtypes (luminal A and B, HER2-enriched, basal-like, and normal-like), which mostly corresponded to hormone receptor and HER2 status, and further stratified luminal tumors based on proliferation. The realization that a significant proportion of the gene expression landscape is determined by the somatic copy number alterations that drive expression in cis led to the newer classification of breast cancers into integrative clusters. This stratification of breast cancers into integrative clusters reveals prototypical patterns of single-nucleotide variants and is associated with distinct clinical courses and response to therapy.},

Although improved treatments and early diagnoses have reduced cancer related mortalities, metastatic disease remains a major clinical challenge. The local tumor microenvironment plays a significant role in cancer metastasis, where tumor cells respond and adapt to a plethora of biochemical and biophysical signals from stromal cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Due to these complexities, there is a critical need to understand molecular mechanisms underlying cancer metastasis to facilitate the discovery of more effective therapies. In the past few years, the integration of advanced biomaterials and microengineering approaches has initiated the development of innovative platform technologies for cancer research. These technologies enable the creation of biomimetic in vitro models with physiologically relevant (i.e. in vivo-like) characteristics to conduct studies ranging from fundamental cancer biology to high-throughput drug screening. In this review article, we discuss the biological significance of each step of the metastatic cascade and provide a broad overview on recent progress to recapitulate these stages using advanced biomaterials and microengineered technologies.

Such extensive epithelial cell turnover is governed by the primitive mammary stem cells (MaSCs) that proliferate and differentiate into bipotential and lineage-restricted progenitors that ultimately generate the mature breast epithelial cells. These cellular processes are orchestrated by tightly-regulated paracrine signals and crosstalk between breast epithelial cells and their tissue microenvironment. However, current evidence suggests that alterations to the communication between MaSCs, epithelial progenitors and their microenvironment plays an important role in breast carcinogenesis. In this article, we review the current knowledge regarding the role of the breast tissue microenvironment in regulating the special functions of normal and cancer stem cells. Understanding the crosstalk between MaSCs and their microenvironment will provide new insights into how an altered breast tissue microenvironment could contribute to breast cancer development, progression and therapy response and the implications of this for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to target cancer stem cells.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Angiogenesis plays an important role not only in the growth and regeneration of tissues in humans but also in pathological conditions such as inflammation, degenerative disease and the formation of tumors. Angiogenesis is also vital in thick engineered tissues and constructs, such as those for the heart and bone, as these can face difficulties in successful implantation if they are insufficiently vascularized or unable to connect to the host vasculature. Considerable research has been carried out on angiogenic processes using a variety of approaches. Pathological angiogenesis has been analyzed at the cellular level through investigation of cell migration and interactions, modeling tissue level interactions between engineered blood vessels and whole organs, and elucidating signaling pathways involved in different angiogenic stimuli. Approaches to regenerative angiogenesis in ischemic tissues or wound repair focus on the vascularization of tissues, which can be broadly classified into two categories: scaffolds to direct and facilitate tissue growth and targeted delivery of genes, cells, growth factors or drugs that promote the regeneration. With technological advancement, models have been designed and fabricated to recapitulate the innate microenvironment. Moreover, engineered constructs provide not only a scaffold for tissue ingrowth but a reservoir of agents that can be controllably released for therapeutic purposes. This review summarizes the current approaches for modeling pathological and regenerative angiogenesis in the context of micro-/nanotechnology and seeks to bridge these two seemingly distant aspects of angiogenesis. The ultimate aim is to provide insights and advances from various models in the realm of angiogenesis studies that can be applied to clinical situations.},

Due to several material limitations, PDMS has not been widely adopted for commercial applications that require large-scale production. This paper describes a novel injection-molded plastic array 3D culture (IMPACT) platform that incorporates a microfluidic design to integrate patterned 3D cell cultures within a single 96-well (diameter = 9 mm) plate. Cell containing gels can be sequentially patterned by capillary-guided flow along the corner and narrow gaps designed within the 96-well form factor. Compared to PDMS-based hydrophobic burst valve designs, this work utilizes hydrophilic liquid guides to obtain rapid and reproducible patterned gels for co-cultures. When a liquid droplet (i.e. cell containing fibrin or collagen gel) is placed on a corner, spontaneous patterning is achieved within 1 second. Optimal dimensionless parameters required for successful capillary loading have been determined. To demonstrate the utility of the platform for 3D co-culture, angiogenesis experiments were performed by patterning HUVEC (human umbilical endothelial cells) and LF (lung fibroblasts) embedded in 3D fibrin gels. The angiogenic sprouts (with open lumen tip cells expressing junctional proteins) are comparable to those observed in PDMS based devices. The IMPACT device has the potential to provide a robust high-throughput experimental platform for vascularized microphysiological systems. is},

Multicellular spheroids containing endothelial cells and lung fibroblasts were embedded within a hydrogel inside a microchannel, and then, endothelial cells were seeded into both sides of the hydrogel so that angiogenic sprouts from the cell spheroids and the microchannels were anastomosed to form a 3D vascular network. Solution containing cells and reagents can be perfused inside the cell spheroids through the vascular network by injecting it into a microchannel. This method can be used to study cancer cell migration towards 3D co-culture spheroids through a vascular network. We recapitulated a bone-like microenvironment by culturing multicellular spheroids containing osteo-differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), as well as endothelial cells, and fibroblasts in the device. After the formation of vascularized spheroids, breast cancer cells were injected into a microchannel connected to a vascular network and cultured for 7 days on-chip to monitor cellular migration. We demonstrated that migration rates of the breast cancer cells towards multicellular spheroids via blood vessels were significantly higher in the bone-like microenvironment compared with the microenvironment formed by undifferentiated MSCs.

Growing evidence suggests that many of these induced ECM proteins play a major functional role in breast cancer progression and metastasis. A number of the induced ECM proteins have moreover been shown to be essential components of metastatic niches, promoting stem/progenitor signaling pathways and metastatic growth. ECM remodeling enzymes are also markedly increased, leading to major changes in the matrix structure and biomechanical properties. Importantly, several ECM components and ECM remodeling enzymes are specifically induced in breast cancer or during tissue regeneration while healthy tissues under homeostasis express exceedingly low levels.

	abstract = {This work presents a micropillar-based microfluidic system, which was designed mainly for three-dimensional (3D) cardiac cell culture, but it can be also used for two-dimensional (2D) cell culture. 3D cell culture was based on the use of the hydrogel, which is gelled by the contact with culture medium inside the microsystem. The geometry of the designed microsystem provided gelation of the liquid hydrogel-cells mixture (3D) and location of the cells (2D) in the middle of the main microchannel. This process was facilitated by the presence of micropillar array. Furthermore, the integration of the designed microsystem with the multi-well plate reader allowed to monitor cell proliferation in situ during the cultures. The designed microsystem was successfully applied to 3D and 2D human cardiomyocytes cultures for 4 days. It was also used as cardiac cell culture model for the investigation of isoproterenol cytotoxicity. The results of both cultures in the designed microsystem indicated that cardiomyocytes proliferated better in 3D than 2D conditions and the cytotoxic effect of investigated drug was lower in 3D than 2D culture. We suggest that the presented microsystem could be a promising microfluidic heart model for analysis of various drugs.},

In contrast to the preferred two-dimensional cell-based screening, three- dimensional (3D) systems havemore in vivo relevance as well as ability to perform as a predictive tool for the success or failure of a drug screening campaign.3Dcell culture has shown an adaptive response to the recent advancements in microfluidic technologies which has allowed better control over sphe- roid sizes and subsequent drug screening studies. In this review, we highlight the most significant developments in the field of microfluidic 3D culture over the past half-decade with a special focus on their benefits and challenges down the lane. With the newer technologies emerging, implementation of microfluidic 3Dculture systems into the drug discovery pipeline is right around the bend.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE
              This study was developed to determine whether descriptive information from a patient-completed questionnaire could provide prognostic information that was independent from that already obtained by the patient's physician.
            
            
              PATIENTS AND METHODS
              An initial detailed questionnaire was administered to approximately 150 patients with advanced cancer. This questionnaire was subsequently revised and given to a total of 1,115 patients with advanced colorectal or lung cancer. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the data from these questionnaires.
            
            
              RESULTS
              A total of 36 variables showed statistically significant prognostic information for survival in univariate analyses, even though many of these variables were associated with only a minimal increase in risk. A multivariate analysis demonstrated that there was a high correlation between many variables. Three major groups of variables became apparent as providing strong prognostic information. These included the following: (1) a physician's assessment of performance status (PS); (2) a patient's assessment of their own PS; and (3) a nutritional factor such as appetite, caloric intake, or overall food intake.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              Data generated by a patient-completed questionnaire can provide important prognostic information independent from that obtained by other physician-determined prognostic factors.},

	abstract = {One of the problems that has slowed the development and approval of new anticancer therapies is the lack of preclinical models that can be used to identify key molecular, cellular and biophysical features of human cancer progression. This is because most in vitro cancer models fail to faithfully recapitulate the local tissue and organ microenvironment in which tumours form, which substantially contributes to the complex pathophysiology of the disease. More complex in vitro cancer models have been developed, including transwell cell cultures, spheroids and organoids grown within flexible extracellular matrix gels, which better mimic normal and cancerous tissue development than cells maintained on conventional 2D substrates. But these models still lack the tissue–tissue interfaces, organ-level structures, fluid flows and mechanical cues that cells experience within living organs, and furthermore, it is difficult to collect samples from the different tissue microcompartments. In this Review , we outline how recent developments in microfluidic cell culture technology have led to the generation of human organs-on-chips (also known as organ chips) that are now being used to model cancer cell behaviour within human-relevant tissue and organ microenvironments in vitro. Organ chips enable experimentalists to vary local cellular, molecular, chemical and biophysical parameters in a controlled manner, both individually and in precise combinations, while analysing how they contribute to human cancer formation and progression and responses to therapy. We also discuss the challenges that must be overcome to ensure that organ chip models meet the needs of cancer researchers, drug developers and clinicians interested in personalized medicine.},

              This paper reports a method for generating an intact and perfusable microvascular network that connects to microfluidic channels without appreciable leakage. This platform incorporates different stages of vascular development including vasculogenesis, endothelial cell (EC) lining, sprouting angiogenesis, and anastomosis in sequential order. After formation of a capillary network inside the tissue chamber
              via
              vasculogenesis, the adjacent microfluidic channels are lined with a monolayer of ECs, which then serve as the high-pressure input (“artery”) and low pressure output (“vein”) conduits. To promote a tight interconnection between the artery/vein and the capillary network, sprouting angiogenesis is induced, which promotes anastomosis of the vasculature inside the tissue chamber with the EC lining along the microfluidic channels. Flow of fluorescent microparticles confirms the perfusability of the lumenized microvascular network, and minimal leakage of 70 kDa FITC-dextran confirms physiologic tightness of the EC junctions and completeness of the interconnections between artery/vein and the capillary network. This versatile device design and its robust construction methodology establish a physiological transport model of interconnected perfused vessels from artery to vascularized tissue to vein. The system has utility in a wide range of organ-on-a-chip applications as it enables the physiological vascular interconnection of multiple on-chip tissue constructs that can serve as disease models for drug screening.},

	abstract = {During the past decade, the three-dimensional organoid technology has sprung up and become more and more popular among researchers. Organoids are the miniatures of in vivo tissues and organs, and faithfully recapitulate the architectures and distinctive functions of a specific organ. These amazing three-dimensional constructs represent a promising, near-physiological model for human cancers, and tremendously support diverse potential applications in cancer research. Up to now, highly efficient establishment of organoids can be achieved from both normal and malignant tissues of patients. Using this bioengineered platform, the links of infection-cancer progression and mutation-carcinogenesis are feasible to be modeled. Another potential application is that organoid technology facilitates drug testing and guides personalized therapy. Although organoids still fail to model immune system accurately, co-cultures of organoids and lymphocytes have been reported in several studies, bringing hope for further application of this technology in immunotherapy. In addition, the potential value in regeneration medicine might be another paramount branch of organoid technology, which might refine current transplantation therapy through the replacement of irreversibly progressively diseased organs with isogenic healthy organoids.},

The advancement of treatment approaches is not at the same rhythm of the disease; making cancer a focal target of biomedical research. To enhance the understanding and prompts the therapeutic delivery; concepts of tissue engineering are applied in the development of in vitro models that can bridge between 2D cell culture and animal models, mimicking tissue microenvironment. Tumor spheroid represents highly suitable 3D organoid-like framework elucidating the intra and inter cellular signaling of cancer, like that formed in physiological niche. However, spheroids are of limited value in studying critical biological phenomenon such as tumor-stroma interactions involving extra cellular matrix or immune system. Therefore, a compelling need of tailoring spheroid technologies with physiologically relevant biomaterials or in silico models, is ever emerging. The diagnostic and prognostic role of spheroids rearrangements within biomaterials or microﬂuidic channel is indicative of patient management; particularly for the decision of targeted therapy. Fragmented information on available in vitro spheroid models and lack of critical analysis on transformation aspects of these strategies; pushes the urge to comprehensively overview the recent technological advancements (e.g. bioprinting, micro-ﬂuidic technologies or use of biomaterials to attain the third dimension) in the shed of translationable cancer research. In present article, relationships between current models and their possible exploitation in clinical success is explored with the highlight of existing challenges in deﬁning therapeutic targets and screening of drug eﬃcacy.},

Studies in 1970s found that trihalomethanes (THMs), which include chloroform, dichlorobromomethane, dibromochloromethane and bromoform, can be formed from chlorinated disinfection processes1. Since that, numerous and even more toxic DBPs have been identified as the result of the wastewater chlorination process. These include, for example nitrosamines2 and cyanide3- 4. Some of these DBPs have been identified as human carcinogens or probable human carcinogens. They could also be toxic to aquatic organisms. Once these DBPs are formed, adding a de-chlorination process will not remove them. Depending on site specific conditions, utilities may have discharge limits on DBPs in their National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits. For comparison purpose, the corresponding maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) in accordance to the primary drinking water standard in US are also included in the table. Similar to other water quality parameters, the limit values of DBPs in NPDES permits vary from plant to plant, depending primarily on the dilution factor of the wastewater effluent discharging into the receiving stream, the target sensitive aquatic organisms to be protected, and the use designation of the receiving stream.},

In this paper, we analyze the role of both B7-1 and B7-2 in the generation of CTLs to nonliving, exogenous Ag and to live virus. To analyze the role of B7 costimulation in the induction of CTLs, we blocked B7-1 and/or B7-2 in vivo by injecting C57BL/6 mice with anti-B7-1 and/or anti-B7-2 mAbs; the mice were subsequently immunized with either chicken OVA that had been cross-linked to beads as a model of exogenous Ags or with wild-type and recombinant vaccinia virus expressing different forms of chicken OVA as models of viral Ags. Our results indicate that B7 costimulation is necessary in the generation of CTLs for all of these Ags. Since the B7 molecules could be costimulating CD8+ and/or CD4+ T cells in wild-type animals, we also examined the role of costimulation in the generation of CTLs to exogenous and viral Ag in MHC class II-deficient mice lacking most CD4+ T cells. In these animals, a combination of both mAbs also blocked all CTL responses, indicating that the Th cell-independent activation of CTLs is dependent upon the B7-costimulatory signals supplied to the CD8+ cell. These findings contribute to the understanding of the role of costimulation for the generation of CTLs. We also discuss the implications of these findings on the role of professional APCs in the initiation of CTL responses.},

	abstract = {In germinal centers (GCs), B cells undergo repeated cycles of proliferation and afﬁnity-based selection, and differentiate into memory B cells or long-lived plasma cells. It has been difﬁcult to elucidate regulatory mechanisms for the dynamic GC B cell maturation and differentiation, partly because experimental manipulation of GC B cells has been limited. Here we describe a culture system in which we can induce massive expansion of naive B cells that exhibit GC B cell-like phenotype and acquire abilities to differentiate into memory B cells or bone marrow plasma cells depending on cytokine conditions. This system will allow us to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of GC B cell differentiation.},

Here, we investigate whether DC, generated in vitro, can directly modulate B cell responses, using CD40L-transfected L cells as surrogate activated T cells. DC, through the production of soluble mediators, stimulated by 3- to 6-fold the proliferation and subsequent recovery of B cells. Furthermore, after CD40 ligation, DC enhanced by 30–300-fold the secretion of IgG and IgA by sIgDϪ B cells (essentially memory B cells). In the presence of DC, naive sIgDϩ B cells produced, in response to interleukin-2, large amounts of IgM. Thus, in addition to activating naive T cells in the extrafollicular areas of secondary lymphoid organs, DC may directly modulate B cell growth and differentiation.},

In mature B cells, the antigen receptor normally consists of two isotypes, membrane IgM and IgD (mIgM, mIgD). Although the signals initiated from both isotypes differ in kinetics and intensity, in vivo, the BCR of either isotype seems to be able to compensate for the loss of the other, reﬂected by the mild phenotypes of mice deﬁcient for mIgM or mIgD. Thus, it is still unclear why mature B cells need expression of mIgD in addition to mIgM. In the current review we suggest that the view that IgD has a simpIy deﬁnable function centred around the basic signalling function should be replaced by the assumption that IgD ﬁne tunes humoral responses, modulates B cell selection and homeostasis and thus shapes the B cell repertoire, deﬁning IgD to be a key modulator of the humoral immune response.},

Resting tonsil B cells, isolated by density gradient centrifugation, express either absent or low levels of Fas. They could be induced to promptly express Fas after ligation of their CD40, however, using either a recombinant human CD40Lig or a cross-linked anti-CD40 mAb. In contrast, engagement of the B cell antigen receptor by immobilized anti-K and -k antibodies did not turn on Fas expression. Addition of anti-Fas mAb CH11 inhibited the later phases of CD40-induced B cell growth as a result of apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, Fas ligation inhibited proliferation and Ig secretion of CD40-activated B cells in response to recombinant cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and IL-10, as well as a cytokine-rich supernatant ofphytohemagglutinin-activated T cells, indicating that none of those B cell tropic factors were able to prevent the Fas-induced death. Taken together, the present results show that engagement of CD40 antigen on B cells induces Fas expression and sensitizes them to Fas-mediated apoptosis. The delayed functional response to Fas ligation after CD40 activation may represent a way to limit the size of a specific B cell clone that is generated during T - B cell interactions.},

Histologic transformation into an aggressive lymphoma, which is expected to occur at a rate of 2 to 3\% each year, is associated with rapid progression, treatment resistance, and poor prognosis. Recent modifications to the physiopathologic mechanism of transformed follicular lymphoma (t-FL) have been proposed, including genetic and epigenetic mechanisms as well as a role for the microenvironment. Although t-FL is considered a devastating complication, as it is associated with treatment-refractory disease and a dismal outcome, recent data in the rituximab era have suggested that not only is the prognosis less severe than reported in the previous literature but the risk of transformation is also lower. Thus, this study aimed to review the most recent research on t-FL in an attempt to better understand the clinical meaning of transformation from FL to diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and the impact of current treatment strategies on the curability of this intriguing subentity of lymphoma.},

The key transcription factors ThPOK and Runx3 have been identiﬁed as mediating development of helper and cytotoxic T cell lineages, respectively. Together with increasing knowledge of epigenetic regulators, these ﬁndings have advanced our understanding of the transcription factor network regulating the CD4/CD8 dichotomy. It has also become apparent that CD4+ T cells retain developmental plasticity, allowing them to acquire cytotoxic activity in the periphery. Despite such advances, further studies are necessary to identify the molecular links between TCR signaling and the nuclear machinery regulating expression of ThPOK and Runx3.},

Over the last two decades, studies designed to define the role of the B cells as APCs have generated discrepant results, showing that B cells are either unnecessary or required for T cell priming and either immunogenic or tolerogenic to T cells. The reasons for these discrepancies are not clear. Here we review mechanisms regulating B cell antigen presentation and the data derived from the major studies conducted by different groups representing each school of thought. In general it is clear that B cells process and present specific and nonspecific antigens differently. The presentation of specific antigen through the B cell antigen receptor occurs with very high efficiency and is associated with B cell activation, resulting in the activation of cognate T cells. In contrast, the presentation of nonspecific antigen by B cells is minimized and dissociated from B cell activation. As a result, B cells inactivate T cells that recognize nonspecific antigenic epitopes presented by B cells, or they induce regulatory T cell differentiation or expansion. These mechanisms serve to ensure effective production of high-affinity antigen-specific antibodies but minimize the production of nonspecific antibodies and autoantibodies.},

This process is facilitated and focused through the extremely efficient uptake, processing, and presentation of antigen recognized by an individual B cell's unique B-cell receptor (BCR). The investigation of human B-cell antigen presentation has been limited by the varied specificity of BCR found in the mixed populations of B cells in vivo. As a result, there is no readily available method to measure BCR-mediated antigen presentation in this heterogeneous population of B cells. We have overcome this limitation by developing HLA-DRrestricted T-cell lines capable of recognizing a speciﬁc antigen taken up via the BCR and presented by the mixed B-cell population through this physiologically relevant mechanism. BCR-mediated presentation was enhanced N 4 logs compared to presentation by B cells taking up the antigen through nonspeciﬁc mechanisms. The studies presented here characterize T-cell hybridoma lines developed for HLA-DRB1*0101+ and HLA-DRB1*1501+ B cells, but clones could be generated for other HLA-DR types using the methods described. These hybridomas have potential applications including study of the mechanisms of BCR-mediated enhancement of presentation, determination of adjuvant effects on presentation, and optimization of vaccine antigen preparations. Therefore, these T-cell lines could signiﬁcantly facilitate the study of BCR-mediated antigen presentation required by T helper cell-dependent vaccines in humans.},

As in other APCs, antigen presentation by B cells involves antigen internalization, antigen processing, and peptide loading onto MHC molecules. However, while the mechanism of antigen processing has been studied extensively in other APCs, this pathway remains elusive in B cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the MHC class II processing pathway in CD40-activated B cells (CD40Bs), as a model for activated, antigen-presenting B cells. Using CMV pp65 as a model antigen, we evaluated processing and presentation of the CD4 + T-cell epitope 509-523 (K509) by human CD40Bs in ELISPOT assays. As expected, stimulation of speciﬁc CD4 + T-cell clones was attenuated after pretreatment of CD40Bs with inhibitors of classic class II pathway components. However, proteasome inhibitors such as epoxomicin limited antigen presentation as well. This suggests that the antigen is processed in a nonclassical, cytosolic MHC class II pathway. Further experiments with truncated protein variants revealed involvement of the proteasome in processing of the N and C extensions of the epitope. Access to the cytosol was shown to be size dependent. Epoxomicin sensitivity exclusively in CD40B cells, but not in dendritic cells, suggests a novel processing mechanism unique to this APC. Our data suggest that B cells process antigen using a distinct, non-classical class II pathway.},

MHCII-containing lysosomes are recruited to the synapse where they locally undergo exocytosis, allowing synapse acidiﬁcation and the extracellular release of hydrolases that promote the extraction of the immobilized Ag. Lysosome recruitment and secretion results from the polarization of the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC), which relies on the cell division cycle (Cdc42)-downstream effector, atypical protein kinase C (aPKCz). aPKCz is phosphorylated upon BCR engagement, associates to lysosomal vesicles, and is required for their polarized secretion at the B cell synapse. Regulation of B lymphocyte polarity therefore emerges as a central mechanism that couples Ag extraction to Ag processing and presentation.},

A direct signal through binding of antigen to membrane Ig can enhance B cell antigen presentation and T­ dependent B cell activation, but is not required for a productive interaction between a small resting B cell and a differentiated helper T cell. As a result of helper T cell recognition of antigen on the B cell surface, the T cell becomes activated and in turn activates the B cell. T cell help has two components: lymphokines which act as growth and differentiation factors for B cells, and additional signals which require cell contact and enable B cells to respond to lymphokines. Contact help activity is regulated like lymphokine synthesis and secretion. Because contact help activity is retained by fixed, activated helper T cells and plasma membranes prepared from activated T cells, contact help is likely to be owing to new proteins expressed as membrane-bound lymphokines or activation antigens on helper T cells. Once induced, contact help can be delivered to B cells independently of recognition of antigen/class II MHC. A newly identified activation antigen of helper T cells, a ligand for the B cell differentiation antigen, CD40, is a key component of contact help. The roles of other T and B cell membrane molecules in contact help are reviewed.},

We aimed to determine autophagy status in primary FL and DLBCL samples and the BCL2+/BCL-2- lymphoma cell lines using both autophagy PCR array and tissue microarray (TMA). A greater number of autophagy machinery genes were up-regulated in the BCL-2+ Su-DHL4 cell line compared with BCL-2- Su-DHL8 cells, at both the basal level and in response to autophagic stress. The autophagy-related gene expression profiles were determined in purified and unpurified malignant human lymph node biopsies. Seven autophagy machinery genes were up-regulated in purified FL B-cells compared with reactive B-cells. Only 2 autophagy machinery genes were up-regulated in DLBCL B-cells. In unpurified tissue biopsies, 20 of 46 genes in FL and 2 of 5 genes in DLBCL with increased expression were autophagy machinery genes. Expression of autophagy substrates p62 and LC3 were determined by TMAs. FL samples showed significantly decreased levels of both p62 and LC3 compared with reactive and DLBCL, indicative of an increased autophagy activity in FL. In summary, these results demonstrate that FL showed increased basal autophagy activity, regardless of overexpression of BCL-2 in this disease.},

The outstanding outcomes in FL make this exercise more difﬁcult than it is in other cancers. Despite the excellent outcomes for the group as a whole, some individual patients do not enjoy such a good prognosis. The observation from the NLCS that POD24 identiﬁes 20\% of patients with 5-year OS of ,50\% is powerful. Furthermore, the observation from the Iowa/Mayo MER database that the 80\% of patients who do not have POD24 have OS similar to age-matched controls without lymphoma is equally powerful. If accurate, one could argue that 80\% of the population with FL does not have an unmet need, and our efforts should focus on the 20\% who do. The problem is that response to therapy is the only tool currently available for reliable identiﬁcation of this very-high-risk group. Future research should (1) expand efforts to identify prognostic biomarkers capable of identifying high-risk patients at diagnosis, (2) continue to develop targeted agents used in association with predictive biomarkers, and (3) test interventions designed to reduce the risk for histologic transformation. Achievement of these goals would facilitate a more personalized approach to the management of FL.},

This allows T-B cooperation, a cellular communication that is required for B cells to develop into germinal centers (GC) and form mature high-afﬁnity antibody producing cells and to further develop B cell memory. MHC class II antigen presentation by B lymphocytes is a multistep process involving (1) Recognition and capture of external Ag by B lymphocytes through their B cell receptor (BCR); (2) Ag processing, which comprises the degradation of Ag in internal compartments within the B cell and loading of the corresponding peptide fragments on MHC class II molecules and (3) Presentation of MHCII-peptide complexes to CD4+ T cells.

	abstract = {Intravenous (i.v.) injection of high amounts of soluble proteins often results in the induction of antigen-specific tolerance or deviation to helper rather than inflammatory T cell immunity. It has been proposed that this outcome may be due to antigen presentation to T cells by a large cohort of poorly costimulatory or IL-12–deficient resting B cells lacking specific immunoglobulin receptors for the protein. However, previous studies using T cell activation in vitro to assess antigen display have failed to support this idea, showing evidence of specific peptide–major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II ligand only on purified dendritic cells (DC) or antigen-specific B cells isolated from protein injected mice. Here we reexamine this question using a recently derived monoclonal antibody specific for the T cell receptor (TCR) ligand formed by the association of the 46-61 determinant of hen egg lysozyme (HEL) and the mouse MHC class II molecule I-Ak. In striking contrast to conclusions drawn from indirect T cell activation studies, this direct method of TCR ligand analysis shows that i.v. administration of HEL protein results in nearly all B cells in lymphoid tissues having substantial levels of HEL 46-61–Ak complexes on their surface. DC readily isolated from spleen also display this TCR ligand on their surface. Although the absolute number of displayed ligands is greater on such DC, the relative specific ligand expression compared to total MHC class II levels is similar or greater on B cells. These results demonstrate that in the absence of activating stimuli, both lymphoid DC and antigen-unspecific B cells present to a similar extent class II–associated peptides derived from soluble proteins in extracellular fluid. The numerical advantage of the TCR ligand–bearing B cells may permit them to interact first or more often with naive antigen-specific T cells, contributing to the induction of high-dose T cell tolerance or immune deviation.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, B cells have been best known for their role as producers of antibodies. However, in recent years, a growing body of evidence has accumulated showing that B cells fulfill a range of other immunologic functions. One of the functions that has attracted increasing attention is the capacity of B cells to induce antigen-specific activation of T cells through presentation of antigens. However, the analysis of this B cell function has been hampered by the lack of a phenotypically well-defined antigen-presenting B cell subset. Here, we report the identification of a human antigen-presenting B cell subset with strong immunostimulatory properties. This B cell subset is characterized by low expression of CD21 and high expression of the activation marker CD86 and exhibits strong T cell–stimulatory activity, as demonstrated by means of an autologous mixed-lymphocyte reaction. Phenotypically, CD21lowCD86pos immunostimulatory B cells (BAPC) represented CD27+ class-switched IgMnegIgDneg B lymphocytes and displayed a higher expression of cell surface receptors, which mediate the migration from peripheral blood to sites of inflammation. Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood obtained from individuals with inflammatory conditions revealed that the BAPC subset was expanded following vaccination and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Taken together, our work shows that BAPC represents a strongly immunostimulatory B cell subset, which could be a promising target for immunotherapeutic intervention in inflammatory diseases. J.

Cathepsin activity was assessed using chemical probes allowing biochemical and in vivo imaging, revealing increased activity associated with the angiogenic vasculature and invasive fronts of carcinomas, and differential expression in immune, endothelial, and cancer cells. A broad-spectrum cysteine cathepsin inhibitor was used to pharmacologically knock out cathepsin function at different stages of tumorigenesis, impairing angiogenic switching in progenitor lesions, as well as tumor growth, vascularity, and invasiveness. Cysteine cathepsins are also upregulated during HPV16-induced cervical carcinogenesis, further encouraging consideration of this protease family as a therapeutic target in human cancers.},

We have generated transgenic mice expressing class II molecules that cannot interact with CD4 but that are otherwise competent to present peptides to the T cell receptor. MHC class II expression was reconstituted in A␤ gene knock-out mice by injection of a transgenic construct encoding either the wild-type I-A␤b protein or a construct encoding a mutation designed to specifically disrupt binding to the CD4 molecule. We demonstrate that the mutation, EA137 and VA142 in the ␤2 domain of I-Ab, is sufficient to disrupt CD4–MHC class II interactions in vivo. Furthermore, we show that this interaction is critical for the efficient selection of a complete repertoire of mature CD4؉ T helper cells as evidenced by drastically reduced numbers of conventional CD4؉ T cells in animals expressing the EA137͞VA142 mutant I-Ab and by the failure to positively select the transgenic AND T cell receptor on the mutated I-Ab.

Our work has focused on [he differential expression ofthe cysteine proteinases cathepsins L (CL) and S (CS) and its pertinence to the generation of MHC class II: peptide complexes. Analysis of CL-deficient mice revealed a profound defect in invariant chain degradation in thymic cortical epithelial cells bur not in bone marrow-derived antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages), Tbe tissue-specific deficiency reflected the restricted pattern of expression of CL and CS in these cell types - CL is expressed in tbymic cortical epithelial cells but not in DC or B cells, wbile CS exhibits the opposite expression pattern.

The cysteine protease cathepsin S is highly expressed in spleen, lymphocytes, monocytes, and other class II–positive cells, and is inducible with interferon-␥. Specific inhibition of cathepsin S in B lymphoblastoid cells prevented complete proteolysis of Ii, resulting in accumulation of a class II–associated 13 kDa Ii fragment in vivo. Consequently, the formation of SDS-stable complexes was markedly reduced. Purified cathepsin S, but not cathepsin B, H, or D, specifically digested Ii from ␣␤Ii trimers, generating ␣␤–CLIP complexes capable of binding exogenously added peptide in vitro. Thus, cathepsin S is essential in B cells for effective Ii proteolysis necessary to render class II molecules competent for binding peptides.},

	abstract = {Purpose Although rituximab (R) is commonly used for patients with advanced follicular lymphoma (FL) requiring treatment, the optimal associated chemotherapy regimen has yet to be clariﬁed. Patients and Methods We conducted an open-label, multicenter, randomized trial among adult patients with previously untreated stages II to IV FL to compare efﬁcacy of eight doses of R associated with eight cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) or six cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) or six cycles of ﬂudarabine and mitoxantrone (FM). The principal end point of the study was time to treatment failure (TTF).
Results There were 534 patients enrolled onto the study. Overall response rates were 88\%, 93\%, and 91\% for R-CVP, R-CHOP, and R-FM, respectively (P ϭ .247). After a median follow-up of 34 months, 3-year TTFs were 46\%, 62\%, and 59\% for the respective treatment groups (R-CHOP v R-CVP, P ϭ .003; R-FM v R-CVP, P ϭ .006; R-FM v R-CHOP, P ϭ .763). Three-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 52\%, 68\%, and 63\% (overall P ϭ .011), respectively, and 3-year overall survival was 95\% for the whole series. R-FM resulted in higher rates of grade 3 to 4 neutropenia (64\%) compared with R-CVP (28\%) and R-CHOP (50\%; P Ͻ .001). Overall, 23 second malignancies were registered during follow-up: four in R-CVP, ﬁve in R-CHOP, and 14 in R-FM.
Conclusion In this study, R-CHOP and R-FM were superior to R-CVP in terms of 3-year TTF and PFS. In addition, R-CHOP had a better risk-beneﬁt ratio compared with R-FM.},

	abstract = {T cells are the key mediators in cell-mediated immunity. Their development and maturation involve a complex variety of interactions with nonlymphoid cell products and receptors. Highly specialized to defend against bacterial and viral infections, T cells also mediate immune surveillance against tumor cells and react to foreign tissues. T cell progenitors originate in the bone marrow and, through a series of deﬁned and coordinated developmental stages, enter the thymus, differentiate, undergo selection, and eventually mature into functional T cells. The steps in this process are regulated through a complex transcriptional network, speciﬁc receptor-ligand pair interactions, and sensitization to trophic factors, which mediate the homing, proliferation, survival, and differentiation of developing T cells. This review examines the processes and pathways involved in the highly orchestrated development of T cell fate speciﬁcation under physiological as well as pathological conditions.},

The transgene demonstrates a lymphoid pattern of expression and uniformly results in an expanded folllcular center cell population. Hyperplastic splenic follicles coalesce to form massive regions of splenic white pulp. Mice over 15 weeks of age demonstrate regional lymphadenopathy with abnormal cellular infiltrates. The expanded lymphoid compartment is composed predominantly of polyclonal B220-positive, IgMllgD-positive B cells.

The ensuing studies led to the discovery of the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR), which is assembled from Ig µH and surrogate light (SL) chains, together with the signaling molecules Igα and β. It is expressed on a fraction of pro-B (pre-BI) cells and most large pre-B(II) cells, and has been implicated in IgH chain allelic exclusion and down-regulation of the recombination machinery, assessment of the expressed µH chains and shaping the IgH repertoire, transition from the pro-B to pre-B stage, pre-B cell expansion, and cessation.},

	abstract = {Classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is characterized by a few tumor cells surrounded by a protective, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment composed of normal cells that are an active part of the disease. Hodgkin and Reed–Sternberg (HRS) cells evade the immune system through a variety of diﬀerent mechanisms. They evade antitumor eﬀector T cells and natural killer cells and promote T cell exhaustion. Using cytokines and extracellular vesicles, they recruit normal cells, induce their proliferation and “educate” (i.e. reprogram) them to become immunosuppressive and protumorigenic. Therefore, alternative treatment strategies are being developed to target not only tumor cells but also the tumor microenvironment. Here we summarize current knowledge on the ability of HRS cells to build their microenvironment and to educate normal cells to become immunosuppressive. We also describe therapeutic strategies to counteract formation of the tumor microenvironment and related processes leading to T cell exhaustion and repolarization of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages.},

	abstract = {Background The natural history of follicular lymphoma is believed not to have changed over the last 30 years. Median survivals have ranged from 7 to 10 years, and the disease is considered incurable. However, multiple new treatment options have been developed in the last decade, and their impact on survival of follicular lymphoma remains unknown. Patients and Methods In the current analysis, we identiﬁed all previously untreated, advanced-stage, follicular lymphoma patients treated with the following three sequential treatment approaches: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy Ϯ nonspeciﬁc immunostimulants (Southwest Oncology Group [SWOG] 7426 and 7713: 1974 to 1983); prednisone, methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide (ProMACE) plus mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) Ϯ interferon (SWOG 8809: 1988 to 1994); and CHOP followed by monoclonal antibody (MoAb) therapy (SWOG 9800 and 9911: 1998 to 2000). We assessed the patients’ progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The MoAb trials included CHOP followed by rituximab (SWOG 9800) and CHOP followed by 131I-tositumomab (SWOG 9911).
Results The PFS curves for the CHOP and ProMACE-MOPP studies are overlapping, with 4-year PFS estimates of 46\% and 48\%, respectively. However, the PFS rate of the CHOP ϩ MoAb studies is signiﬁcantly improved at 61\% (P ϭ .005). The OS curves show improvement with each succeeding study. The 4-year estimate of OS is 69\% for the CHOP regimens, 79\% for the ProMACE-MOPP study, and 91\% for the CHOP ϩ MoAb regimens (P Ͻ .001). These conclusions were retained after adjusting for differences in prognostic factors between the study groups.
Conclusion The results of this study suggest that OS for patients with follicular lymphoma has improved over time and that the choice of initial therapy may matter.},

We compared three diﬀerent methods (immunoﬂuorescent microscopy, IFM; ﬂow cytometry, FCM; polymerase chain reaction, PCR) for the rapid and quantitative detection of Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium parvum (oo)cysts in a ﬁeld campaign. For this we deployed our mobile instrumentation and sampled canal water and vegetables during a 2 week ﬁeld study in Thailand. For puriﬁcation and concentrations of (oo)cysts, we used ﬁltration and immunomagnetic separation. We were able to detect considerably high oo(cysts) concentrations (ranges: 15−855 and 0− 240 oo(cysts)/liter for Giardia and Cryptosporidium, respectively) in 85 to 300 min, with FCM being fastest, followed by PCR, and IFM being slowest due to the long analysis time per sample. FCM and IFM performed consistently well, whereas PCR reactions often failed. The recovery, established by FCM, was around 30\% for Giardia and 13\% for Cryptosporidium (oo)cysts. It was possible to track (oo)cysts from the wastewater further downstream to irrigation waters and conﬁrm contamination of salads and water vegetables. We believe that rapid detection, in particular FCM-based methods, can substantially help in disaster management and outbreak prevention.},

	abstract = {Ensuring safe and effective water treatment, distribution, and reuse requires robust methods for characterizing and monitoring waterborne microbes. Methods widely used today can be limited by low sensitivity, high labor and time requirements, susceptibility to interference from inhibitory compounds, and difﬁculties in distinguishing between viable and non-viable cells. Flow cytometry (FCM) has recently gained attention as an alternative approach that can overcome many of these challenges. This article critically and systematically reviews for the ﬁrst time recent literature on applications of FCM in water treatment, distribution, and reuse. In the review, we identify and examine nearly 300 studies published from 2000 to 2018 that illustrate the beneﬁts and challenges of using FCM for assessing source-water quality and impacts of treatment-plant discharge on receiving waters, wastewater treatment, drinking water treatment, and drinking water distribution. We then discuss options for combining FCM with other indicators of water quality and address several topics that cut across nearly all applications reviewed. Finally, we identify priority areas in which more work is needed to realize the full potential of this approach. These include optimizing protocols for FCM-based analysis of waterborne viruses, optimizing protocols for speciﬁcally detecting target pathogens, automating sample handling and preparation to enable real-time FCM, developing computational tools to assist data analysis, and improving standards for instrumentation, methods, and reporting requirements. We conclude that while more work is needed to realize the full potential of FCM in water treatment, distribution, and reuse, substantial progress has been made over the past two decades. There is now a sufﬁciently large body of research documenting successful applications of FCM that the approach could reasonably and realistically see widespread adoption as a routine method for water quality assessment.},
